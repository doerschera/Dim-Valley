###Background

These two games center around a fictional town of Dim Valley, which the player must save from impending and complete darkness by performing an ancient ritual. *StarWord* and *NebuLost* are parts one and two of what will be a three part game series. *StarWord* is a hangman style game where players must guess letters contained in certain words, which represent an ancient chant. Each time a guess is incorrect one of seven stars falls from the sky. Once all the stars fade the town succombs to darkness. After all seven of the secret words have been guessed the player can move on to the next chapter. In *NebuLost* users must navigate through the suburban streets of Dim Valley to find the location of the ritual space. This game is based off of the board game *Mastermind*, where one player tries to the guess the order of colored pegs set by the second player. Here, those pegs are houses and the player has five guesses to find the correct color order of six houses. With each incorrect guess, a black cloud moves closer and closer to the town, eventually send it into darkness. Once the user makes five successful guess that can move on the next chapter.

###Technology

- DOM manipulation via vanilla JS (*StarWord*)
- DOM manipulation via jQuery (*NebuLost*)
- Digital illustration in Photoshop & Illustrator
- HTML/CSS
- Responsive design

###Process

These games started with the narrative of Dim Valley and the overarching goal of preventing darkness. Inspiration for the story and aesthetic came from the podcast *Welcome to Nightvale*, a community radio report from the strange town of Nightvale, which features absurd imagery such as glow cloud as school board president, floating cats, and creatures that are definitely not angels and all named Erika (so you should really listen to it).

This was my first time using vanilla Javascript to manipulate the DOM and gave me a great appreciation for the ease of the jQuery library. Writing these games also helped me solidify my basic logic skills and gain confidence in providing user interaction feedback to events. One bug I have yet to solve involves the letters a through d in *Starword*, which will not dim once clicked, but only if they are in the word to be discovered...
